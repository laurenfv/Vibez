> This front-end web app takes any sentence and returns music based on that sentence's emotion. It does so by using the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API to get the sentiment value from a sentence or phrase, and then, using that data the app queries the Spotify API for songs of matching energy, valence, and danceability.

## Motivation
 
  Music is a fundamental part of our lives. It can either fuel the fire that flares within or soothe the savage beast scratching at the walls. However, sometimes we have trouble figuring out how exactly we’re feeling, or finding a song that expresses the sentiments we are harboring in any given moment. We wanted to create an application that gives  people a chance to find music that resonates with them without having to spend too much time or effort to do so. 
  
  Additionally, music can often help bring people together, and so we included a feature in our application that stores other users’ search queries. This provides a snapshot of what other people are feeling and listening to, things that might be on the same frequency as what you’re looking for.It can provide solace to users with the simple fact that other people are, or at one point were feeling the exact same way as they are now.

## How to Use

  Log in with your Spotify account to access the app, type into the search bar any sentence you like, and then check out some new music!
